**Caesar Cipher Encryption and Decryption**

**Introduction**

This repository contains a Python implementation of the Caesar Cipher algorithm, a simple substitution cipher used for encrypting and decrypting messages. 
The Caesar Cipher shifts each letter in the plaintext by a fixed number of positions down the alphabet. This project allows users to input a message and a shift value to perform both encryption and decryption.

**Features**

Encrypt text using the Caesar Cipher algorithm.
Decrypt text that was encrypted using the Caesar Cipher algorithm.
Handles both uppercase and lowercase letters.
Retains non-alphabetic characters (they are not altered during encryption/decryption).

**How to Use**

**Prerequisites**
Python 3.x installed on your system.
Running the Program
Clone this repository to your local machine.

  git clone https://github.com/jeb21/Prasunet_CS_01.git
  
  cd caesar-cipher
  
Run the Python script.
